# atproto-lexicon-ts

generated typescript code for the atproto lexicon

this repo basically just generates the lexicon code in [the atproto repo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto)
using their [cli generation tool](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/tree/main/packages/lex-cli).

first run `build.sh` to build the atproto submodule (you might need to `git clone` differently to get the atproto repo.  alternatively, adjust `generate.sh` to point to your atproto repo.

second, run `generate.sh`, or take a look for some inspiration.
